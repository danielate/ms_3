# As I shared with you in our last meeting. I had a midterm review for my thesis
# project today so my focus had been mainly on getting through it. Having
# successfully completed that, I will put up more work to get this project to
# the right level. I wrote up the content of my about page as a regular HTML
# file, I also started experimenting with the Shiny, you will find some work on
# that on the ms_3 subfolder. Finally, the folder ms_3_raw_data contains the
# datasets I have selected so far for my analysis. I will work on processing
# them this week.

# **About**

## Gender inequality for Women in the Informal Economy in Latin America  

#### **Project Background and Motivations**  

Identity has several dimensions, including gender, race, sexuality, and class,
and these intersecting links influence a personâ€™s daily life. Therefore, a
gender analysis that utilizes an intersectional lens is essential to designing
and implementing equitable international development projects. This project aims
to compare markers of gender inequality with data on women workers in the
informal economy in Latin A merica, with the goal of analyzing how this already
vulnerable group is restricted by issues of race, class, gender and culture.
